## Data Science Question
**How is climate change shaping the intensity and frequency of hurricanes, and what emerging insights can we uncover about future hurricane patterns?**

In this question, we explore the growing influence of climate change on the dynamics of hurricanes. Specifically, how can we analyze the impact of rising surface temperatures on the severity and frequency of these storms? Ultimately, this data science project hopes to provide insights that help guide policymakers on strategies that can save lives, reduce economic losses, and foster greater sustainability commitments towards the future.

## Data Description
**Hurricane Dataset:**  
We use the **IbTrACS** database for this project, a global dataset of hurricanes, tropical storms, and cyclones, focusing on storms recorded after 1980. The dataset has dozens of columns to accommodate differences in recording across countries. Relevant fields include: Subbasin where the storm formed, Time of recording, Latitude and longitude of the storm, Wind speed and pressure, Hurricane category

We will augment this dataset with **Global Temperature Data** from the Global Temperatures Dataset, a compilation of average temperatures across various regions since 1750. Compiled by **Berkeley Earth** (affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), it provides temperature data at granularities including country, city, state, and specific longitude and latitude.

## Project Solution
We plan to create a global visualization illustrating how rising temperatures across different regions correlate with the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes. Additionally, we will conduct predictive analyses to forecast various hurricane characteristics based on rising temperatures in specific locations. This will enable us to anticipate the likelihood and severity of hurricanes under different climate scenarios, providing valuable insights for proactive disaster preparedness.
