The world is getting warmer every day, and so is the debate over whether the human race should be concerned about it. With many extreme weather events in recent times affecting millions[TODO: Add ref], we seek to discover evidence of this phenomenon being caused by global warming. To this resolve, we first visualize evidence by combining two datasets that recorded every extreme weather event between 1980 and 2013 [TODO: ref Storm_dataset] and the daily global temperatures [TODO: ref temp]. [TBD: ref pages?] We first contrast the yearly hurricane count during these years with the average land and ocean temperatures. While that doesn't give an apparent correlation, we also visualize the path of these hurricanes on a 2D globe and get glimpses of how they get more severe across the years. This led us to visualize the hurricane counts across different severity levels and give a better indication of a rise in the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes and a trend spanning multiple years. Finally, to bring it all together, we see the effects of these events on land by tracing their path across different months and years. With this evidence, we developed a prediction model for global temperature and the expected hurricane severity at the user's input location and date.

## Introduction
Our planet is heating up at an alarming pace, evidenced by 2023 being the hottest year yet on record [[1](https://climate.copernicus.eu/global-climate-highlights-2023)]. This is primarily caused by human activities that involve burning fossil fuels, leading to greenhouse gas emissions that trap more heat from the sun. Studies [[2](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/)] have demonstrated that extreme weather events, such as heat waves, floods, droughts, etc., are becoming more frequent and extreme due to climate change, with one study [[3](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html)] showing a 74% correlation. Aggravating this problem is world leaders not acknowledging the problem and its gravity [[4](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-12-02/climate-change-united-states-cop29-trump)]. This primarily stems from misinterpretation or lack of evidence and projections that prove the effects of global warming and how it can and is already wreaking havoc on human civilization. With reports [[5](https://www.rms.com/catastrophe-modeling-report-2023)] estimating losses to the tune of $100 billion and almost 100 million lives affected, education on the subject and its solution are need of the hour.

To generate meaningful insights, we focus on one of the extreme events, hurricanes, and demonstrate how the rising temperatures have made them more common and extreme. We provide evidence through interactive visualization and a predictive dashboard highlighting how worse the trend could be!
