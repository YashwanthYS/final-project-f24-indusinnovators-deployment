The world is getting warmer every day, and so is the debate over whether the human race should be concerned about it. With many extreme weather events in recent times affecting millions[TODO: Add ref], we seek to discover evidence of this phenomenon being caused by global warming. To this resolve, we first visualize evidence by combining two datasets that recorded every extreme weather event between 1980 and 2013 [TODO: ref Storm_dataset] and the daily global temperatures [TODO: ref temp]. [TBD: ref pages?] We first contrast the yearly hurricane count during these years with the average land and ocean temperatures. While that doesn't give an apparent correlation, we also visualize the path of these hurricanes on a 2D globe and get glimpses of how they get more severe across the years. This led us to visualize the hurricane counts across different severity levels and give a better indication of a rise in the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes and a trend spanning multiple years. Finally, to bring it all together, we see the effects of these events on land by tracing their path across different months and years. With this evidence, we developed a prediction model for global temperature and the expected hurricane severity at the user's input location and date.
