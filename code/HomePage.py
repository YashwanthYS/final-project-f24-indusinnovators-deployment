st.markdown("""
Welcome to the interactive platform for exploring the relationship between **global temperatures** and the **frequency and intensity of hurricanes and storms**. 
This project aims to analyze historical and current data to provide insights into how climatic factors influence these phenomena.

### Explore the Dashboards
Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between dashboards. Each dashboard offers an in-depth exploration of different aspects:
- Trends in **global temperatures** over decades with hurricane counts.
- Storm life cycle (variation over each day)
- Serverity levels of the storms over time
- The relationship between **land and ocean temperatures** and hurricane activity.
- Geographic patterns and their correlation with **storm intensity**.
