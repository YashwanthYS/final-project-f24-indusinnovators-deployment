Welcome to the interactive platform for exploring the relationship between **global temperatures** and the **frequency and intensity of hurricanes and storms**. 
This project aims to analyze historical and current data to provide insights into how climatic factors influence these phenomena.

### Explore the Dashboards
Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between dashboards. Each dashboard offers an in-depth exploration of different aspects:
- ‚Å†Trends in **global temperatures** over decades with hurricane counts.
- ‚Å†Storm life cycle (variation over each day)
- ‚Å†Severity levels of the storms over time
- **Regional** storm and temperature patterns over time
- ‚Å†Predictions of **future temperatures** and **hurricane season intensity** .
